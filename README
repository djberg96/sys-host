= Description
  An interface for getting host information.  

= Installation
  gem install sys-host

= You may not need this
  This library was one of my first ever, and was originally created largely
  as an exercise to learn C extensions with Ruby. However, in the many years
  that have passed since I first created it, most of its functionality has been
  rendered obsolete by continued extension of Ruby's builtin Socket library.

  Please check to see if the Socket library doesn't already do what you need
  before using this gem.
   
= Synopsis
