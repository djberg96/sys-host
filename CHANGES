== 0.6.3 - ???
* Refactored the Rakefile clean task, and removed the old install task.
* Removed a deprecated gemspec call.

== 0.6.2 - 20-Mar-2010
* Changed license to Artistic 2.0.
* The Host.host_id method has been modified to return a hex value on MS
  Windows in order to be consistent with other platforms.
* Some internal directory layout changes and corresponding changes to the
  Rakefile.
* Additional Rakefile tasks that remove the need for some code that was
  previously inlined into the gemspec directly.
* Updated the gemspec, including an updated description, the addition of a
  license, and changing test-unit to a development dependency.

== 0.6.1 - 18-Nov-2008
* Added the host_id method for Windows, which just returns the MAC address.
* Fixed an issue in the Host.ip_addr method for MS Windows where multiple ip
  addresses might not be handled properly. Thanks go to Murmansk Manny for the
  spot and patch.
* Updated the gemspec to include all .c and .h files now so that it should
  successfully build and install on all Unix platforms.
* Rakefile fix for MS Windows for the install task.
* The test file is now "test_sys_host.rb".

* Bug/warning fix for OS X.
* HostError is now Host::Error.
* Added a Rakefile, including tasks for installation and testing.
* Fixed the gemspec (I hope).
* Lots of internal reorganization, including the removal of the install.rb
  file. That's handled by the Rakefile.

== 0.5.2 - 27-Jun-2006
* Added the Host.info method for Linux.

== 0.5.1 - 3-Mar-2006
* The Host.info method is now supported on Solaris.

== 0.5.0 - 3-Jul-2004
* Replaced Windows C extension with pure Ruby version, using WMI + OLE.
* Added an additional class method called 'info' that returns a HostInfo
  struct.  Currently on Windows only.
* Removed the block form of Host.ip_addr. It now simply returns an Array.
* Renamed and revamped test suite.
* Moved test.rb to doc/examples
* Removed the host.html file.
* Replaced previous exception classes with a single exception class,
  HostError, and moved it under the Sys module namespace.

== 0.4.0 - 15-Jun-2003
* Added MS Windows support
* Modified extconf.rb file - generic test script now in its own file
  (test/test.rb) and the dynamic rd2 stuff was removed, in addition to proper
  handling for MS Windows
* rd2, txt and html docs now included by default
* Removed VERSION() class method (use the constant instead)
* Added a universal constants.h file to store VERSION info, etc, that
  is common to all source files.
* Added LICENSE info

== 0.3.4 - 3-Apr-2003
* Fixed a header include issue for solaris systems that don't
  define inet_ntop().

== 0.3.3 * 24-Mar-2003
* If inet_ntop() is not defined, now falls back to inet_ntoa().

== 0.3.2 - 14-Mar-2003

* Added a test suite (for those with testunit installed)
* Removed the sys-uname requirement
* Changelog and Manifest are now CHANGES and MANIFEST, respectively
* Minor internal layout changes
* rd2 documentation removed from C source files and put into 'doc'
  directory

== 0.3.1 - 6-Jan-2003
* Fix to make code C89 compliant so that older compilers don't choke.
* Added a VERSION class method
* Added a copyright notice
* Moved README into doc/host.txt
* Minor doc changes
* Fixed extconf.rb file to include socket lib for Solaris.  This was
  in 0.2.0 and was mistakenly left out of 0.3.0.

== 0.3.0 - 28-Oct-2002
* Reentrant (thread-safe) support added for ip_addr() method (for Linux,
  FreeBSD and Solaris currently).
* The file layout changed so that each platform has its own source file.
  This was done because different platforms have different implementations
  of gethostbyname_r(), if they have them at all.  Some platforms (e.g.
  FreeBSD) use a different function altogether.
* The file generic.c is used to create the source if the platform is not
  currently supported, or if gethostbyname_r() isn't found.
* The FreeBSD implementation uses getipnodebyname() instead of
  gethostbyname(), if possible.  According to the man page, it's thread
  safe.
* Modifications to the extconf.rb file based on the above changes.
* Added a default value of 16 for INET_ADDRSTRLEN.
* Added a README file.

== 0.2.0 - 1-Sep-2002
* Added HostException and HostAddressException classes.  These are raised
  in the event the gethostname or gethostbyname call fails, respectively.
* Removed some unnecessary (and warning-causing) free calls.
* Added an INSTALL file (installation instructions removed from core doc).

== 0.1.2 - 9-Aug-2002
* Got the BSD support working properly this time.  Thanks to Sean
  Chittenden for providing BSD access.

== 0.1.1 - 21-Jun-2002
* Fixed a bug that would cause the ip_addr to segfault on some
  operating systems.  Apparently ,trying to free memory on a 
  null pointer is a bad thing.  Hey, Solaris didn't complain!
  Thanks go to Han Holl for the spot.
* On *BSD systems the 'netinet/in.h' file is now included (via
  the makefile).  Thanks go to Magnus Stahre for the spot and
  the fix.
* Changed the version number to be more "ruby compliant"

== 0.01 * 11-Jun-2002
* First release!
