== Description
   Provides hostname and ip address information for a given host.
    
== Synopsis
   require 'sys/host'
   include Sys

   p Host.hostname
   p Host.ip_addr
    
   # Some platforms
   Host.info{ |h|
      p h
   }

== Constants
VERSION
    Returns the current version number of this library (as a string)
    
== Class Methods
Host.hostname
    Returns the hostname of the current host.  This may or not return
    the FQDN, depending on your system.
    
Host.ip_addr
   Returns a list of IP addresses for the current host (yes, it is
   possible to have more than one).
    
Host.info(host=localhost)
Host.info(host=localhost){ |h| ... }
   Yields a HostInfo struct for each network adapter on 'host', or an array
   of HostInfo struct's in non-block form.  The exact members of this struct
   vary depending on your platform.
    
== Exception Classes
Host::Error < StandardError
   Raised in the event of a failure for any of the class methods provided
   with this library.  Generally speaking, it means there was a failure in
   the underlying gethostname() or gethostbyname() calls.
    
== Future Plans
   Add support for IPV6.  This will be difficult unless I have access to a
   system on an IPV6 network.  Any help on this front appreciated.
    
== Notes
   The Windows version of this library uses OLE + WMI.  The Host.info method
   returns considerably more information than the *nix versions of this
   library.
