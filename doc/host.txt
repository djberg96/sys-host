== Description
  An interface for retrieving various bits of information about your machine.
    
== Synopsis
  require 'sys/host'
  include Sys

  p Host.hostname
  p Host.ip_addr
    
  # Some platforms
  Host.info.each{ |h|
    p h
  }

== Constants
VERSION
  Returns the current version number of this library (as a string)
    
== Singleton Methods
Host.hostname
  Returns the hostname of the current host.  This may or not return
  the FQDN, depending on your system.
    
Host.ip_addr
  Returns a list of IP addresses for the current host (yes, it is
  possible to have more than one).
    
Host.info(host=localhost)
  Returns an array of HostInfo structs, one for each network adapter on 'host'.
  The exact members of this struct vary depending on your platform.

Host.host_id
  Returns the unique hexadecimal identifier for the current host.
    
== Exception Classes
Host::Error < StandardError
  Raised in the event of a failure for any of the class methods provided
  with this library.  Generally speaking, it means there was a failure in
  the underlying gethostname() or gethostbyname() calls.
    
== Future Plans
  Add support for IPV6. This will be difficult unless I have access to a
  system on an IPV6 network. Any help on this front appreciated.
    
== Notes
  The Windows version of this library uses OLE + WMI. The Host.info method
  returns considerably more information than the *nix versions of this
  library.
